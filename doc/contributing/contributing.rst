Development workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow `Aaron Meurer's description of the git workflow`_.

.. _Aaron Meurer's description of the git workflow: https://www.asmeurer.com/git-workflow/

Briefly:

1. Create a personal fork of this repository.
2. Clone this repo from your fork.
3. Create a branch for your contribution.
4. Make your changes and commit them (testing locally).
5. Push changes to the branch on your remote.
6. Open a pull request via the GitHub website of your fork.

If you are a member of the `qucontrol organization`_, you can omit the first
step and work in the parent GitHub repository directly.

.. _qucontrol organization: https://github.com/qucontrol


Commit messages should be clear and concise. Use the following template:

.. code-block:: none

   Short (72 chars or less) summary

   More detailed explanatory text. Wrap it to 72 characters. The blank
   line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
   the body entirely).

   Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
   bug" or "Fixes bug." The git commit subject line should always be able
   to complete the sentence
   "If applied, this commit will <your subject line here>".

   Reference any issue that is being addressed in the commit, as e.g. "#1"
   for issue #1. If the commit closes an issue, state this on the last line
   of the message (see below). This will automatically close the issue on
   Github as soon as the commit is pushed there.

   Closes #1

See `Linking a pull request to an issue`_ for details on how to reference
issues in commits.

.. _Linking a pull request to an issue: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue


Rel:ases follow `semantic versioning`_ and need to be compatible with `PyPA
version specifiers`_ (former `PEP440`_).

.. _semantic_versioning: https://semver.org/
.. _PyPA version specifiers: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers
.. _PEP440: https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/


Styles and conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Code needs to be compatible with `PEP 8`_. Furthermore, this projects adopts
the `Black code style`_ with a line length limit of 79 characters.

Docstrings are written according to the `NumPy Style Guide`_, e.g. see this
`comprehensive example`_.

.. _PEP 8: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/
.. _Black code style: https://github.com/psf/black#the-black-code-style
.. _NumPy Style Guide: https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html
.. _comprehensive example: https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_numpy.html


.. _dev_install:

Development installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend to use a `virtual environment`_ for developing your contribution.
See for example `this guide`_ for details on how to create one.

.. _virtual environment: https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-virtual-environment
.. _this guide: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#module-venv

To install the package along with additional development dependencies, run

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m pip install -e openquad[dev,extras]

If you donâ€™t have `pip`_ installed, the `Python installation guide`_,
respectively the `Python Packaging User Guide`_ can guide you through the
process.
