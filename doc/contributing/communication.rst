Bugs and feedback
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The best way to send feedback, ask questions or propose a feature is to start a
`discussion on GitHub`_.

To report a bug, open an `issue on GitHub`_.

If you propose a feature:

- Provide a detailed explanation.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible.
- Think about how you can contribute :)

Propose a new quadrature method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We aim to expand this database to cover a broad spectrum of quadrature methods.
If you know a source that you would like to see part of |openquad|, contact us,
either by `opening an issue`_ or `starting a discussion`_.
