Citing OpenQuad
---------------

If |openquad| was helpful for your research and you would like to acknowledge
the project in your academic publication, we suggest citing the following
paper:

* Alexander Blech, Raoul M. M. Ebeling, Marec Heger, Christiane P. Koch, Daniel M. Reich;
  Numerical evaluation of orientation averages and its application to molecular physics.,
  *J. Chem. Phys.* 7 October 2024; 161 (13): 131501. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0230569
